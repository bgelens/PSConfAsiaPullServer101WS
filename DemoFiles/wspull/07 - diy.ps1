    Now we have seen how the pull server operates, it's time to do it yourself!

    * Create configuration with non-inbox resource xCredSSP
    * Compile and stage (think about checksum!)
    * Prepare resource module so LCM can download (think about checksum!)
    * Assign new configuration name to LCM
    * Have LCM converge
